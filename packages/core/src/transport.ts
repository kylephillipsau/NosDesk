/**
 * Transport seam for @nosdesk/core.
 *
 * The web app and the (future) Tauri mobile app speak to the same backend but
 * differ in two ways only: the REST/WS base URL, and how a request is
 * authenticated (web: same-origin httpOnly cookies + a CSRF header; mobile:
 * a bearer token from the keychain, no cookies). Everything else, the 50-odd
 * `*Service.ts` callers, the sync runtime, SSE and collab URL building, is
 * identical.
 *
 * This module is that single seam. The host injects an `AuthStrategy` and the
 * base URLs once at bootstrap via `configureTransport`; core code then calls
 * `apiBaseUrl()` / `sseStreamUrl()` / `collabWsBaseUrl()` and
 * `transport().auth.*` without knowing which surface it runs on.
 *
 * Headless invariant: core can't read `window.location` or `import.meta.env`,
 * so all platform-derived values (the relative-vs-absolute base, the ws/wss
 * protocol swap, any env override) are resolved by the host and passed in.
 * The concrete strategies live in their hosts for the same reason: a cookie
 * strategy reads `document.cookie`, a bearer strategy reads native storage,
 * both DOM/platform concerns. Core owns only the contract below.
