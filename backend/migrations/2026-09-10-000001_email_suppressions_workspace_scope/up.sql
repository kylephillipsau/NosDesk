-- Scope the email suppression list per workspace.
--
-- The table was keyed on the address alone with no `workspace_id`, so the RLS
-- GUC that `TenantConn` primes was a no-op for it and the three admin
-- endpoints had no tenant predicate. On a multi-workspace deployment that let
-- any workspace admin read, add to, and delete from every other tenant's
-- suppression list. Reading it is the sharper half: the module's own doc
-- withholds the list from agents precisely because it reveals email addresses
-- they should not know, and a peer tenant knows them less.
--
-- Suppression is a property of a RELATIONSHIP, not of an address. A manual
-- entry records that this workspace was asked to stop writing to someone, and
-- deleting a peer's entry could resume mail to a person who opted out. Shared
-- sender reputation is the ESP's concern, and SES keeps its own account-level
-- suppression list for exactly that.
--
-- No audit trigger on this table, so the backfill needs no DISABLE TRIGGER
-- dance (the DISABLE/ENABLE pair around it in the initial schema is a
-- seed-load artefact). It is not a partitioned table either.
