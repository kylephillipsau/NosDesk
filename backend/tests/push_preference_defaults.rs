//! Push's default: derived from device presence, never written down.
//!
//! Push is absent from every notification type's `default_channels`, so it
//! resolves in `resolve_channel` instead: `off` while the user has no device
//! (nothing to send to), and `instant` on the types the policy names once one
//! registers.
//!
//! This used to be done by seeding rows into `notification_preferences` when a
//! device registered. Those rows were byte-identical to ones the user wrote by
//! toggling the switch, which defeated the resolver's tri-state (absent means
//! inherit, present means explicit): the UI could not tell a default from a
//! choice, and a workspace admin's default was silently overridden by rows the
//! user never authored. The property pinned below is that registering a device
//! writes nothing at all.
