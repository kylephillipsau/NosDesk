//! API token scope enforcement.
//!
//! This module owns the route policy that maps an incoming request to
//! the scope it requires, plus the predicate that enforces it against a
//! narrowed token's `ScopeSet`. The predicate is called from
//! `api_token::finalize`, so every authenticated request is checked at one
//! point instead of wherever a wrap happens to be stacked.
//!
//! Design:
//!   * `full` credentials (every cookie session and every un-narrowed
//!     token) short-circuit before this policy is consulted. Only
//!     deliberately-narrowed API tokens are constrained.
//!   * The policy returns a `ScopeRequirement`. Anything not explicitly
//!     mapped defaults to `Full`, which a narrowed token can never
//!     satisfy, so a new or cross-cutting route fail-closes rather than
//!     silently widening a narrowed token's reach.
//!   * Scope is a second, orthogonal layer: the handler's existing role
//!     gate still runs. A request must pass both.
