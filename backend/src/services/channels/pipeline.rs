//! Inbound event pipeline.
//!
//! Given a normalized [`InboundEvent`] emitted by some adapter, this
//! module runs it through the fixed stages:
//!
//!   1. **Dispatch on variant.** Only `MessageReceived` is handled in
//!      phase 1. Edits/deletes log and skip — task #15 / #18 will wire
//!      them in once the lifecycle model is settled.
//!   2. **Loop filter.** `LoopMarkers::any()` aborts before any DB work,
//!      so our auto-reply never ping-pongs with an out-of-office.
//!   3. **Dedup.** `channel_messages.(channel_id, external_id, direction)`
//!      is unique; if we've already ingested this message we stop.
//!   4. **Thread resolve.** Adapter-supplied cascade (defaults to
//!      [`super::threading::default_explicit_threading`]) returns
//!      `Some(ticket_id)` for a reply and `None` for a new ticket.
//!   5. **Identity resolve.** Re-uses [`find_or_create_guest_user`] so
//!      drive-by reporters land in the same auto-provisioned state as
//!      public guest submissions.
//!   6. **Persist.** Open ticket (if new) → insert comment → record the
//!      `channel_messages` row with `ticket_id`/`comment_id` links.
//!   7. **Side effects.** Materialize attachments, broadcast SSE, index
//!      for search. Each is optional (via `PipelineContext`) so unit
//!      tests can exercise the pure DB path without live services.
//!
//! The pipeline is deliberately ignorant of *which* channel raised the
//! event — it only reads `channel.provider` and `InboundMessage` fields
//! defined in [`super`]. Adapters that need custom threading override
//! `resolve_thread`; adapters that need custom attachment handling
//! override [`materialize_attachment`]'s External branch by populating
//! Inline before handing to the pipeline.
