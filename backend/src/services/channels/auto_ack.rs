//! Auto-acknowledgement on channel-opened tickets.
//!
//! When a new ticket opens via an inbound channel message, send a
//! single system-authored reply back to the customer:
//!
//! ```text
//! Thanks, we got your message. Reference: #123. Reply to this
//! email if you have more to add; we'll get back to you soon.
//! ```
//!
//! Standard helpdesk behaviour (Zendesk, Freshdesk, Help Scout all
//! ship it on by default). It sets the customer's expectation that
//! the request was received without waiting for a human response.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! - Enabled / template stored on `site_settings` so an admin can
//!   customise wording without a redeploy. `None` template → the
//!   built-in [`DEFAULT_TEMPLATE`] is used.
//! - Fire-and-forget from the pipeline: a failure to send never
//!   blocks ticket creation.
//! - The auto-ack is NOT a ticket comment — it's a system-authored
//!   outbound that gets recorded in `channel_messages` with
//!   `comment_id = NULL`. This means:
//!     * it doesn't clutter the tech-facing comment timeline,
//!     * the customer's reply still threads back correctly via
//!       References → our auto-ack Message-ID → the ticket.
//! - Template substitution is plain string replacement of
//!   `{{variable}}` tokens — no Handlebars, no HTML injection risk
//!   because we render as plain text.
