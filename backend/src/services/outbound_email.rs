//! Per-workspace outbound email resolver.
//!
//! Outbound mail used to flow through a single instance-global
//! `EmailService` built from env. This resolver replaces that single
//! reference: given a workspace, it returns the `EmailService` to send
//! with, built from the workspace's own `workspace_email_settings` row.
//! When the workspace has no identity of its own, the fallback depends on
//! the deployment mode: on self-host the env-configured service is the
//! operator's own identity, so it applies directly (single-tenant self-host
//! is unchanged); on hosted, the workspace instead gets the MANAGED default
//! identity `support@<slug>.<NOSDESK_TENANT_DOMAIN>` — sent through the
//! platform relay but From the tenant's own subdomain, so tenant mail never
//! leaves on the shared platform domain.
//!
//! It is a **stateless builder**, deliberately not a cache. Every send path
//! already reads its DB inputs in a pinned phase and releases the
//! connection before the network send, so the resolver reads settings on
//! the connection the caller already holds ([`resolve_on_conn`]) rather than
//! checking out a second one. Building an `EmailService` is a decrypt plus a
//! `relay()` builder (no socket), so there is nothing worth caching across
//! sends, and no cross-instance staleness to manage.
//!
