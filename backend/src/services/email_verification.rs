//! Address confirmation for emails added to a user profile.
//!
//! An address on a profile is a claim until something proves it. The proof
//! here is the same one the portal sign-in link uses: possession of a link
//! sent to the address. The consequence is much smaller, since clicking it
//! verifies one `user_emails` row rather than signing anyone in.
//!
//! Why the claim needs proving at all: `is_verified` is the inbound-mail
//! impersonation guard (`user_helpers::find_verified_user_by_email`), so an
//! unproven address that counted as verified would let its claimant receive
//! attribution for mail the real owner sent. Before this existed the flag was
//! settable from a request body, which is to say it asserted nothing.
//!
//! The token carries the `user_emails` row id in its `metadata`, not just the
//! user: `reset_tokens` is user-scoped and one user may have several unverified
//! addresses at once, so "which address did they confirm" is not derivable from
//! the token's subject.
