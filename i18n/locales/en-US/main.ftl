## Shared Fluent message catalogue for en-US.

## Loaded by both the Rust backend (via include_str! in
## backend/src/utils/i18n.rs) and the Vue frontend (via Vite glob
## import in frontend/src/i18n/index.ts). The .ftl format is
## Mozilla's Fluent. Keep keys kebab-case, group by feature
## prefix (e.g. password-reset-*, ticket-*) so call sites stay
## predictable.
